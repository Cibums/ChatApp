ChatApp is an app for windows allowing you
to create conversations, add your friends, and
send messages to eachother.

For the application to work you'll have to set up a local server
and a database. If you don't know how to do this, here's instructions:

1. Download and install WAMP from http://www.wampserver.com/

2. Make sure that the WAMP icon in the lower-right corner of windows is green.

3. When WAMP is running correctly, click on the icon and then click phpmyadmin.
   This will open your browser.

4. Login. Usually the username is "root" and the password is completely empty. If this is not the case:
   change the username and password in the config.txt file.

5. Click the button that says import without clicking anything else before that.

6. Click choose file and choose the chatapp.sql file located in the first SQLRegistration folder.

7. Click Run

8. You can now start the application and use it. :)
